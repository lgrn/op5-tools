# Usage information:
#
#   This script will copy and/or move perfdata files for hosts or services
#   to paths specified in the script, if they exist.
#
#   The purpose of this script is to make it easier to use Nagflux and
#   PNP in parallel, or switch between the two, without having to modify
#   your command_line setting in misccommands.cfg -- instead, this script
#   will handle the logic, and will not move the files to a path that does
#   not exist -- or make sure it's in both, if they both exist.
#
# Example:
#
#   ./move_perfdata -c host -t 1543412003
#
#   Normally this would not be run manually, but would be configured in
#   misccommands.cfg as your "command_line" for process-service-perfdata,
#   or process-host-perfdata. Don't forget to change the -c flag:
#
#   define command{
#       command_name process-host-perfdata
#       command_line /opt/monitor/etc/move_perfdata.sh -c host -t $TIMET$
#   }
#
#   "$TIMET" is here a standard Nagios macro that will be replaced before
#   actually running the command.
